# FleetWorkspace

Android Game development for Ron Coleman's Game Design Course

Ideal Rules, once we finish:

Each card represents a ship, and a fleet would consist of only one suit of cards. There are 4 classes of ships.

2-5: Destroyers

5-9: Cruisers

10-King: Battleships

Ace: Carrier

The game would be laid out so that each player has a 3x3 grid to place their cards.

When starting the game a player chooses what their fleet consists of, ending with a total of 9 cards each, then placing their cards face down in their grid. One card is always an Ace.

During a turn a player chooses one ship enemy ship attack and one carrier action. The attacking ship and defending ship are then both flipped face up

Battles results are determined by class

Battleships defeat Cruisers

Cruisers defeat Destroyers

Destroyers defeat Battleships

If a carrier is attacked by any class it is defeated

If an attacking ship defeats the defending ship, the defending ship is sunk. The attacking ship then can be placed face down in any square adjacent to it, switching positions with the ship that was there.

If an attacking ship does not defeat the defending ship, both cards remain face up and in play.

After attacking, if the player’s carrier is still in play they select one of the enemy’s cards and have them flip that card face up.

The game is over when one player runs out of ships.
